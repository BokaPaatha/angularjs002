<!--
1. Add firebase.js   
2. Create an account in firebase. Create an app. https://scorching-inferno-7188.firebaseio.com
3. Create a dataref to that URL. 
4. Send some JSON data to firebase. set() or push()
5. Log into firebase and confirm that the data has reached the cloud db. 
6. Send the same data multiple times. Yup, you could see that. You should have used push() and give it some time.
